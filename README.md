# Coin-Toss-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This project demonstrates how to calculate the probability of getting a specific number of heads when tossing a fair coin multiple times. It compares the theoretical probability from the binomial distribution with the results of a Monte Carlo simulation.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- Python code to simulate coin tosses for 10, 50, and 100 tosses.
- Calculation of theoretical probability using the binomial distribution.
- Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 experiments for each scenario.
- Comparison of theoretical and empirical probabilities.

## How It Works

1. Generate sequences of coin toss outcomes.
2. Count the number of heads for each experiment.
3. Calculate the theoretical probability for exactly:
   - 5 heads in 10 tosses
   - 25 heads in 50 tosses
   - 50 heads in 100 tosses
4. Run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the empirical probability.
5. Compare theoretical and simulated results.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Coin-Toss-Monte-Carlo-Simulation.git

2. Open the notebook in Google Colab **or** run the Python script locally.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to see the output.
