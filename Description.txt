This project explores the probability of getting a specific number of heads when tossing a fair coin 
multiple times. It focuses on three cases: tossing a coin 10 times (target: 5 heads), 50 times (target: 
25 heads), and 100 times (target: 50 heads). The theoretical probability is calculated using the 
binomial distribution formula. A Monte Carlo simulation runs 1000 experiments for each scenario to 
estimate the probability in practice. By comparing theoretical and simulated results, this project 
shows how probability theory and Python simulations work together.
